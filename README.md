# Deploy Client Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.10.

## Stack

- Tailwind
- DaisyUI
- Prettier (formatter)
- Eslint (code rules)
- Transloco (i18n)

## Formatter and code rules

You can find formatter config in the '.prettierrc.json' file. Use format on save in your IDE settings if you want to.

You can find eslint for code rules in the 'eslint.config.js' file.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
